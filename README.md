# PsychoHelp - Student DashBoard (In Progress)

This branch implements the student dashboard for the user type Student.<br>
When it's deployed, it shows three main sections:<br>
- **Your Progress**: This section is where a student can see, as the name says, how much progress they have made with their tests, which are three types. Each of these tests are shown with a status whether it's "completed" or "pending".
- **Recommended Careers**: This sections is where students can see recommendations of different careers based on the results of their tests and their compatibility percentage.
- **Navigation Side Bar**: On the left side of the dashboard, students have easy access to the main functionalities of PsychoHelp to explore.
